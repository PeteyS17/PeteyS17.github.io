          <h2> Info about Modern Aviation</h2>
          <p> Modern comercial airplanes are the backbone of global travel and trade.
            With the ability to carry hundreds of passengers across continents in just a 
            few hours, they have truly transformed the way we live. From wide-body 
            jets like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to the Airbus A350, todays airplanes are 
            marvels of engineering and design. They combine safety, efficiency, and comfort 
            to make air travel more accessible than ever before.</p>

            <p> Commercial planes today use advanced technology to reduce fuel consumption, 
                improve aerodynamics, and increase passenger comfort. Airlines are constantly 
                updating their fleets to newer, more efficient models that produce fewer 
                emissions. Features such as quieter engines, larger windows, and improved cabin 
                layouts make flying a smoother experience. Airplanes have become an essential 
                part of the modern world, connecting people, economies, and cultures.</p>
